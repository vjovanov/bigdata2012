\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented the distributed batch data processing framework \tool that provides an
expressive high-level programming model. \tool uses language virtualization,
lightweight modular staging and side effect tracking to analyze user programs at
runtime. This allows \tool to apply projection insertion, code motion as well as
operation fusion optimizations to achieve high performance for declarative
programs. Through modular code generation \tool allows execution on Spark,
Crunch and Scoobi. Presented optimizations result in speedups of 143\% in Spark and 
126\% in Crunch.

Unlike existing domain-specific approaches \tool provides high-performance,
general and expressive programming model which is integrated into the Scala language.
It allows high performance user extensions and code portability between different distributed batch data processing frameworks.
