\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented the big data processing library \tool that provides an expressive high level programming model. \tool uses language virtualization, lightweight modular staging and side effect tracking to analyze user programs at runtime. This allows \tool to apply projection insertion, code motion as well as operation fusion optimizations to achieve high performance for declarative programs. Through modular code generation \tool allows execution on Spark, Crunch and Scoobi. Presented optimizations result in speedups of 148\% in Spark, 59\% in Crunch and 38\% in Scoobi.   

Unlike existing domain specific approaches \tool provides high performance, general and expressive programming model which is integrated into the Scala language. It allows performant user extensions and code portability between different big data processing frameworks.
