\section{Operation Fusion}
\label{sec:fusion}

% In the programming model ops are high level, and connecting them would require inefficient glue code. Moreover the short functional operations like map, filter and flatMap have very little scopes so optimization over different copes is impossible. In order to gain oppurtunities we have implemented fusion of operations map, flatMap and filter through underlying loop fusion algorithm described in section \ref{subsec:background}.
