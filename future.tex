\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future-work}

From the wide range of relational optimizations, \tool currently supports only
early projection. In the future work we plan to introduce early filtering which
will push filter operations before the expensive operators that require a
barrier. Also, we plan to include program analysis phase which will allow
building of indexes.

Text and XML processing are often processed in cluster computing and efficient
processing of it can greatly reduce cost and energy consumption. With that in
mind we plan to integrate \tool with other text parsing DSLs that are deeply
embedded into the standard library. If prototyping shows that performance gains
are significant we will add DSL modules for regular expressions, Scala parser
combinators and XML library.

\tool currently only operates on distributed datasets so programs written in it
can not be used for in memory data. We plan to integrate \tool with Delite
\cite{brown_heterogeneous_2011} collections DSL which supports very efficient
execution of batch operations. Delite also allows running queries on
heterogeneous hardware architectures where jobs are scheduled for execution on
both CPU and GPU processors.
