\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future-work}

From the wide range of relational optimizations, \tool currently supports only
 projection insertion. In future work we plan to introduce early filtering
 which will push filter operations in front of expensive operators that
 require a barrier. Also, we plan to include a program analysis phase which will
 allow building of indexes.

Text and XML processing are common in cluster computing and optimizations for
it can greatly reduce cost and energy consumption. With that in mind we plan to
integrate \tool with other text parsing DSLs that are deeply embedded into the
standard library. If prototyping shows that performance gains are significant,
we will add DSL modules for regular expressions, Scala parser combinators and XML library.

\tool currently only operates on distributed datasets so programs written in it
can not be used for in memory data. We plan to integrate \tool with Delite
\cite{brown_heterogeneous_2011} collections DSL which supports very efficient
execution of batch operations. Delite also allows running queries on
heterogeneous hardware architectures where jobs are scheduled for execution on
both CPU and GPU processors.
