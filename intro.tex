\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In the past decade numerous programming models models have been developed for distributed data parallel processing. Starting with MR and Dryad (low level interfaces) followed by dryad/linq, flume java, spark (high level interface) and pig and Hive with SQL like interface.

With mentioned programming models we observe that there is a tradeoff between high level, productive models which have performance penalty, domain specific approaches that laverage a narrow programming model but provide high level optimizations and low level interfaces like Dryad and MapReduce that are very hard to program in.

% Should we mention the code portability as one of major points or use it as additional contribution?

% Proposed optimizations

% We build upon the work of Delite and LMS and try to use Embedded DSL 

% Effects, compiler optimizations, domain specifc optimizations.

% Evaluation
