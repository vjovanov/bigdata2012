\section{Programming Model}
\label{sec:programming-model}

% Scala and Spark and Collections like interface
The basic abstraction in our programming model is the interface
\scode{DColl[T]}. \scode{DColl[T]} represents a distributed collection of
elements that have type \scode{S} which is a subtype of \scode{T}. The elements
of a \scode{DColl[T]} collection are immutable, so each operation on the list
can only: \emph{i)} produce a new \scode{DColl}, \emph{ii)} save it to
persistent storage, \emph{iii)} materialize it on the master node or \emph{iv)}
return an aggregate value.

% Operations and reference to the Table. monadic operations, concat,
% partitionBy, cache, count returns the value
\code{DColl} operations are presented in Table \ref{tbl:operations}. In the left
column, we show which frameworks support which method. The middle column shows
the method name. Finally, the right column contains the type of \code{DColl}
that the operation is called on, and return type of the operation.

\label{tbl:operations}
\end{table*}

Operations \code{DColl()} and \code{save} are used for loading and storing data
to the persistent storage. \code{map, filter} and \code{flatMap} are standard
methods for transforming the data by applying the argument function. These can
also be used with Scala \code{for} comprehensions. Operations
\code{groupByKey}, \code{join}, \code{cogroup}, \code{cross} and \code{reduce}
are applicable only if the elements of \code{DColl} form a key/value pair.
\code{reduce} is used for general aggregation after the \code{groupByKey},
\code{join, cogroup} and \code{cross} are different types of relational joins.
\code{sort} sorts the data set, \code{partitionBy} defines partitioning among
machines, and \code{cache} signals that the data should be kept in cluster
memory for faster future accesses. Two \code{DColl}s can be concatenated by the
\code{++} operation. A DColl can be materialized on the master node by calling
\code{materialize}.

Some methods accept functions as their parameters. Code within these functions
can be either written in the \tool DSL, or by using existing functions from an
external library or common JVM libraries. Using JVM libraries requires just one
extra line of code per method.

% Example word count application
In Listing \ref{lst:wordcount}, we show an implementation of a simple word count
example. We notice that the code does not show any \code{Rep} types.
Since a large subset of the Scala library is implemented as a DSL module, functions like
\code{split} and string concatenation are used the same way as they are in
Scala. In the second line, the regular (with arguments wrapped in \code{Rep})
method \code{parse} is passed to the \code{map} method. Pig and Hive do not have
functions in their own language, but allow writing user defined functions in
other languages which requires a considerable amount of boilerplate code.

% Word count showing generality, rep clean api.
\begin{lstlisting}[name=code, caption=An example of a simple word count
program., captionpos=b, label=lst:wordcount, float=t] 
val read = DColl("hdfs://..." + input)
val parsed = read.map(WikiArticle.parse(_))
parsed.flatMap(_.plaintext.split("\\s"))
  .map(x => (x, 1))
  .groupByKey()
  .reduce(_ + _)
  .save("hdfs://..." + output)
\end{lstlisting}

All methods except for \code{cache} and \code{sort} can be mapped to methods in
Spark and Crunch. Other back-ends (including Dryad) provide these
primitives as well. The \code{cache} method currently works with Spark only but
it can be added to the interface of other back-ends, in which it would have no
effect, such that the code stays portable. From existing frameworks today only
HaLoop \cite{bu_haloop:_2010} and Twister \cite{ekanayake_twister:_2010} can
benefit from it, however we did not implement code generation for them. Method
\code{sort} is inconsistent in most of the frameworks so we have not mapped
uniformly to all of them. However, with slight modifications to the framework
implementations it could be supported as well. \code{sort} can also be
implemented in \tool itself by using \code{takeSample} and \code{partitionBy}.
